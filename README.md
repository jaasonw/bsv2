# 🧾 Never Fight Over the Check Again

**Stop the awkward math, end the payment disputes, eliminate the "I'll get you back later" promises.**

We've all been there: the bill arrives, everyone pulls out their phones to calculate their share, someone inevitably pays too much, and you're stuck tracking who owes what. Meanwhile, your dinner gets cold and the good vibes disappear.

## The Problem You Know Too Well

- 🤔 **Mental math anxiety** when the bill has 12 items and 5 people
- 💸 **Someone always overpays** (and yes, they remember)
- 📱 **Endless back-and-forth** on group chats about who owes what
- ⏰ **Wasted time** calculating splits while everyone waits
- 🤷 **Confusion over tips and taxes** - do we split evenly or proportionally?

## Your Solution is Here

**Just snap a photo of your receipt.** Our AI instantly reads every item, price, tax, and tip. Assign who ordered what with a few taps. Get exact amounts for everyone. Pay and go.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast

### 📱 Works Everywhere
