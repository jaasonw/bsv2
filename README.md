# bill splitter v2

remake of bill splitter but in react because in a shocking turn of events, svelte was starting to piss me off for my future plans for this app

# use case / pitch

imagine you go out to eat with friends, everyone orders their own meal, the entire group decides to split 2 sides, 2 people decide to share a drink,
and when the bill comes someones saying that they didn't actually eat any of the second side.
how the hell do you manage all this?

the solution i eventually settled on was a spreadsheet but i eventually decided that i didnt want to manually make that spreadsheet all the time so i made an app to automate a spreadsheet
